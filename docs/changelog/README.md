# Change Log

List the most significant changes.

## 4.1.3

- Fix bug that saved some data in wrong context storage.

## 4.1.2

- Fix so configured values for output are sent, not only true/false.
- Catch error from Elvia API so NR does not crash.

## 4.1.1

- Update dependencies

## 4.1.0

- Fix bug with override function. It did not override longer than until next scheduled change. Now it overrides until set to auto again.
- Show override on node status.
- Fix name filter on schedule merger node.

## 4.0.0

This is a major rewrite of some of the central code, in order to lay ground for further development and maintenance.
There are a couple of new nodes that open for many interesting use cases.
A rewrite like this may lead to changes in behavior, intended or not.
There are some breaking changes, but most users should not be affected by them.

### New features

- New node `ps-schedule-merger` or `Schedule Merger`, used to merge schedules from multiple Best Save and/or Lowest Price nodes,
  as well as the new Fixed Schedule node.
- New strategy node `ps-strategy-fixed-schedule` or `Fixed Schedule`, to set a fixed daily or weekly schedule.
  The main purpose of this node is to function as a mask for other strategies when merged using the Schedule Merger,
  but it can also be used alone.
- For Best Save and Lowest Price you now can configure the output value, sent on output 1 and 2 to turn on or off.
  Default is true/false as before, but you can configure to send for example 1 and 0, or "on" and "off", or any
  other number or string values.
- The config output on Best Save and Lowest Price (as well as the new Schedule Merger) has a new attribute: `hasChanged`.
  It is set to `true` if the config just was changed by a config input message.
- You can now donate using Vipps :-)

### Breaking changes

- The old Power Saver node has been removed, as it has been deprecated for a long time.
- The `sentOnCommand` output has been removed.
- Some bug-fixes may be regarded as breaking.
- There may be some changes to what data that is stored in the context.

### Bug fixes

- Fix so the `If no schedule, send` config works as one should expect for the end of the schedule.
  If the last scheduled switch is different from this setting, a switch to the
  value set by this setting will be scheduled on the first hour after the whole schedule, normally at midnight.
  The `countHours` value for this schedule will be `null`, as it is impossible to say how many hours it will last for.
- Fixed also so `If no schedule, send` works if the schedule only exists for the future. Then this value is used until the
  time for the first scheduled value is reached.
- Fixed Best Save and Lowest Price so when rescheduling, for example if prices are received,
  and `Send when rescheduling` is not checked,
  output to output 1 or output 2 is only sent if it has not been sent before,
  or if it is changed by the new schedule. This is to avoid sending output when not
  necessary, that is if there is no change. Of course, if the `Send when rescheduling` is checked,
  output is sent anyway.

  NB! If for some reason a switch did not catch the last output, this may lead to it not being switched
  until the next scheduled switch. If you get trouble with that, you can always enforce switch output
  by sending the [`sendOutput` command](../nodes/dynamic-commands.html#sendoutput).

- Fix price receiver so it works when price is 0.
- Fixed bug in Lowest Price and Best Save for 0 prices.
- Improved error handling for Elvia Add Tariff.

## 3.6.2

- Fix bug in Elvia API causing Node-RED to crash when the API key was wrong. Not it shows status `Unauthorized` and survive.

## 3.6.1

- Fix bug in Best Save node, so a better saving is not overwritten by a not as good saving in an overlapping period. This bug could occur in rare cases when a shorter savings period gave better results than a longer.

## 3.6.0

- New feature `Max price` for Lowest Price node. Can be set to only turn on if prices is below or equal to the max price.
- New value in output 3 from the Lowest Price and Best Save nodes, `countHours`, telling the number of hours that the value will stay.

## 3.5.7

- Add day-filter to general-add-tariff node so it can add one tariff for some days, and another tariff for other days.
- Fix the elvia-add-tariff node so time is correct. The Elvia API does not handle time zone on the request, so this must be corrected for.
- Fix link to node-documentation in node edit dialogs.

## 3.5.6

- Update Elvia nodes so they use the new `digin` API. NB! There is no guarantee this is working right.
