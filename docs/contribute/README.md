# Contribute

## Donate

Developing software is time consuming. This solution took the better part of my free time for a couple of years, and still takes a lot of time. Getting something back would make it easier to also spend future time on this.

The software is open source, and you can use it for free, but if you feel it has value, you can support the development by donating, paying a fee of your choice.

## Code

It would be very nice to get more developers on board, and become a team. If you satisfy the following criteria, I would be happy to get help on developing this further:

- Professional or experienced developer
- Know JavaScript
- Write automated tests for your code
- Use `node-red-contrib-power-saver`
- Want to collaborate on further development

Please contact me, for example by making a [GitHub issue(https://github.com/ottopaulsen/node-red-contrib-power-saver/issues)] explaining what you would like to do.

The first and most important task now, is to make support for getting grid tariff from all suppliers.

## Examples

It would be very nice to get more examples into the documentation. If you have made something smart, please describe in a markdown-file and either send me, or preferably make a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/ottopaulsen/node-red-contrib-power-saver/pulls).

## Bug reports

If you find a bug, please describe it thoroughly and make a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/ottopaulsen/node-red-contrib-power-saver/issues).
