# Contribute

## Donate

Developing software is time consuming. This solution has taken the better part of all my free time for a couple of years now. Getting something back would make it easier to also spend future time on this.

<VippsPlakat/>

The software is open source, and you can use it for free, but if you feel it has value, you can support the development by donating or becoming a patron, paying a fee of your choice.

## Code

It would be very nice to get more developers on board, and become a team. If you satisfy the following criteria, I would be happy to get help on developing this further:

- Professional or experienced developer
- Know JavaScript
- Write automated tests for your code
- Use `node-red-contrib-power-saver`
- Want to collaborate on further development

Please contact me, for example by making a [GitHub issue(https://github.com/ottopaulsen/node-red-contrib-power-saver/issues)] explaining what you would like to do.

The first and most important task now, is to make support for getting grid tariff from all suppliers.

## Examples

It would be very nice to get more examples into the documentation. If you have made something smart, please describe in a markdown-file and either send me, or preferably make a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/ottopaulsen/node-red-contrib-power-saver/pulls).

## Bug reports

If you find a bug, please describe it thoroughly and make a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/ottopaulsen/node-red-contrib-power-saver/issues). If the bug is related to the scheduling, **please provide the full output from output 3** on the strategy node.

## Ideas

If you have ideas for new features, please make a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/ottopaulsen/node-red-contrib-power-saver/issues) and describe it as detailed as possible.
