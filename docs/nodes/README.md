# Nodes

Here is an overview of the nodes, and links to detailed descriptions for eah of them.

## Strategy nodes

These are the nodes used to calculate and control saving.

### [ps-strategy-best-save](./ps-strategy-best-save)

![ps-strategy-best-save](../images/node-ps-strategy-best-save.png)

Strategy to find the best hours to postpone power consumption to achieve the most saving.

### [ps-strategy-lowest-price](./ps-strategy-lowest-price)

![ps-strategy-lowest-price](../images/node-ps-strategy-lowest-price.png)

Strategy to find the x hours with lowest price in a given period each day.

### [ps-strategy-heat-capacitor](./ps-strategy-heat-capacitor) <Badge type="warning">Experimental</Badge>

![ps-strategy-heat-capacitor](../images/node-ps-strategy-heat-capacitor.png)

A strategy for moving consumption from expensive to cheap periods utilizing climate entities and trading principles.

### [ps-strategy-fixed-schedule](./ps-strategy-fixed-schedule)

![ps-strategy-fixed-schedule](../images/node-ps-strategy-fixed-schedule.png)

A strategy for setting a fixed daily or weekly schedule.

## Utility nodes

### [ps-receive-price](./ps-receive-price)

![ps-receive-price](../images/node-ps-receive-price.png)

Node to convert different types of input data to the format used by the strategy nodes.

### [ps-schedule-merger](./ps-schedule-merger)

![ps-schedule-merger](../images/node-ps-schedule-merger.png)

Node to combine multiple schedules into one schedule.

## Grid tariff nodes

### [ps-general-add-tariff](./ps-general-add-tariff)

![ps-general-add-tariff](../images/node-ps-general-add-tariff.png)

Node to add a variable grid tariff (or any value) to the prices before sending them to the strategy nodes.

### [ps-elvia-add-tariff](./ps-elvia-add-tariff)

![ps-elvia-add-tariff](../images/node-ps-elvia-add-tariff.png)

Node to add Elvia grid tariff to the prices before sending them to the strategy nodes.

## Other nodes

These are a couple of other nodes for using the Elvia API, but these are not important to the Power Saver, so they are not given any further documentation here.

### ps-elvia-tariff-types

Use this to get a list of the tariff types available in the Elvia API.

### ps-elvia-tariff

Use this to get the Elvia grid tariff for a selected tariff type.
